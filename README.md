# Setup

Requires **Python 3.12** or later. In production, Python 3.14 on Linux is used. To manage multiple Python versions in a single machine, we recommend [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/).

Make sure `git` (unless downloading directly from GitHub) and `python3` (3.12 or later) are installed, and you have set up the bot and its **bot token** through [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). You may want to prepare a "system" Discord server (internally known as System Guild) from which you can run `system` commands.

## Steps

1.  Clone this repository, either via GitHub or using `git clone`:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mifuyutsuki/mitsuki.git mitsuki
    cd mitsuki
    ```

2.  Create and activate the virtual environment to isolate dependencies:
    ```bash
    # Python venv (use the right activate script according to your shell)
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate

    # pyenv + pyenv-virtualenv (3.14)
    pyenv install 3.14
    pyenv local 3.14
    pyenv virtualenv 3.14 mitsuki-py3.14
    pyenv activate mitsuki-py3.14
    ```

3.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    # Production dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Development dependencies (optional) - additionally includes pytest and jurigged
    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    ```

4.  Create data and settings directories and files:
    ```bash
    mkdir data                                        # Directory for the SQLite database
    mkdir settings                                    # Directory for some bot settings
    cp defaults/settings.yaml settings/settings.yaml  # Customize bot settings if needed
    cp example.env .env                               # Discord bot token goes here
    ```

5.  Update the settings above using your text editor of choice:
    ```bash
    nvim .env
    nvim settings/settings.yaml
    ```

6.  Run the bot:
    ```bash
    # Production mode
    python3 run.py

    # Development mode (runs jurigged for hot code reloading)
    python3 run.py dev
    ```
