# Mitsuki bot settings file.
#   To modify these settings for your Mitsuki bot, copy this file to a
#   gitignored path, such as ./assets and ./settings. This ensures a smooth
#   update process from the Mitsuki repository.


mitsuki:
  # Path to default (base) messages file.
  #   To avoid issues when updating Mitsuki from repository, avoid modifying
  #   the defaults file directly. Instead, create another messages.yaml file
  #   in a gitignored path, such as ./assets and ./settings.
  messages_default: "defaults/messages.yaml"

  # Path to custom messages file.
  #   Templates in this file will overwrite defaults in messages_default.
  messages: 

  # Daily reset time.
  #   Determines the reset time for certain functions, such as /gacha daily.
  # 
  # Format: HH:MM+hhmm <or> HH:MM-hhmm
  #   HH:MM   daily reset time (24-hour time)
  #   +hhmm   daily reset timezone (+0000 for UTC)

  # Status messages ("Playing ...").
  status:
  - "Magical Mitsuki"

  # Time to cycle to next status, in seconds.
  #   Setting this value to 0 or having only one status message disables
  #   status cycling. For rate limit reasons, this setting has a hard minimum
  #   of 60 seconds.
  #   
  # Note:
  #   The cycle resets after a bot restart.

  db_use: "sqlite"

  # Path to database.
  #
  # Notes for sqlite:
  #   Paths are relative to Mitsuki root path.
  #   Add an initial slash to use absolute paths.
  #   For Windows absolute paths, use "/C:\\path\\to\\db.sqlite3".
  # 
  # [FUTURE] Notes for postgresql:
  #   Include only the database host and database name:
  #     localhost/mitsuki
  #   Database username (DB_USERNAME) and password (DB_PASSWORD) are separately
  #   configured in .env.
