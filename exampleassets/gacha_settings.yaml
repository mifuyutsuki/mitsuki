# from 0 to 1 denoting probability of rolling a given rarity.

# (Hard) pity value.
# 
# Pity is a mechanic that guarantees a certain rarity within a set amount of
# rolls. For example, if the rarity-2 pity value is 10, if a player has not
# obtained a rarity-2 for 9 consecutive rolls (assuming there is rarity-1),
# the player is guaranteed to obtain the rarity-2 at the next roll. Said pity
# counter is reset if a rarity-2 is rolled.
# 
# If two different rarities hit pity at the same time, the higher rarity would
# be rolled, making it possible for pity counters to go past the pity value. 
pity:
  # s2: 10
