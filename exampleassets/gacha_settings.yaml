# Gacha rates.
# 
# [NOTE] Rarity values are no longer limited to 9 as in v1.1.
# 
# Rarities, or more technically qualities, are denoted with numbers from 1.
# Higher numbers indicate higher rarities/qualities. For the settings below,
# keys start with a letter, such as s1.
# 
# For the true rate, each rate value is divided by the sum of all rate values.
# The below rates will be equal to the true rate if all rate values sum to 1.
rates:
  s1: 0.785
  s2: 0.185
  s3: 0.030

# (Hard) pity value.
# 
# Pity is a mechanic that guarantees a certain rarity within a set amount of
# rolls. For example, if the rarity-2 pity value is 10, if a player has not
# obtained a rarity-2 for 9 consecutive rolls (assuming there is rarity-1),
# the player is guaranteed to obtain the rarity-2 at the next roll. Said pity
# counter is reset if a rarity-2 is rolled.
# 
# If two different rarities hit pity at the same time, the higher rarity would
# be rolled, making it possible for pity counters to go past the pity value. 
pity:
  # s2: 10

# Gacha currency obtained on rolling an already owned item (dupe) per rarity.
